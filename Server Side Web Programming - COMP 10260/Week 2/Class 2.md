###### **Introduction**
- Deterministic Programs
	- Input determines the output
- **Statements**
	- Assignment
	- Expressions
	- Iteration
	- Conditionals
	- Execution
	- Something else
- **Variables and Data Types**
	- Manipulates with operators
- **Type Check** - PHP
	- Dynamic:
		- Checks type while running
		- Attempts to convert variable into needed type
	- Static:
		- Think of Java
- **PHP Has 8 Primitive Data Types**
	- Integer
	- Floats
	- String
	- Boolean 
	- Array - Supports Associative Arrays
	- Object
	- NULL
	- Resource
###### **Assignments**
- Variables:
	```php
	//Variables declared with a $
	//Statements end with a ;
	$variable = "Thomas";
	$array = array("Thomas", "Coons");
	```
 
###### **Operations and Expressions**
- **Arithmetic Operators:**
```
	addition + 
	subtraction - 
	multiply *
	divide /
```
- **Assignment Operators**
```
	+=
	-=
	*=
	/=
```
- **Comparison Operators**
```
	==
	===
	!=
	<> greater / lesser
	!==
```
- **Logical Operators**
```
	and
	or
	xor
	!
```
- **Conditional Assignment Operator (Turnary)**
```php
	$a ? $b : $c;
	//If a is true, b is returned
	//If a is false, c is returned
```
- **Increment Operators**
```php
	$b = ++$a; //pre
	$b = $a++; //post
```
- **String Operators**
```php
	. //String concatenation
	= //Combines second string to first
	[n] //Slicing using indexes
	$b[0] = $a; //Changing the index 0 of specific string
```
- **Order of Operations for Operators**
```
	++ or --
	* or / 
	+ - .
	?:
	= or += or -= or *= or /=
	.......missing info
```
