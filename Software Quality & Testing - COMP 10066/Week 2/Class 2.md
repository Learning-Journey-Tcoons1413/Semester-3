###### ==**Best Practices** TEST QUESTION==
- Style - code format
- Syntax - correct syntax
- Simplicity - 
- Solution - solves the problem
- Sailing - reusability 

###### **Refactoring**
- Restructuring code without breaking it 
- Doesn't change the interface
- Improve Readability 
- Updating new technologies 
###### **Backpacking Rule**
- Leave the mess cleaner than when we found it 
###### **Version Control**
- A way to document our files and keep track of them. 
- **Source Code Control is the Management of**:

- add - adds in files
- commit - adding source code changes
- clone - clones a repo in a new directory 
- checkout - switch branches, allows selection of an old commit or file revision
- merge - merges changes back to the main branch
- push - sends a series of commits to move a local branch to another repo 
- fetch - downloads a branch, but doesn't integrate. Allows manual inspection before merge.
- pull - automates version of fetch, downloads branch and attempts to merge
