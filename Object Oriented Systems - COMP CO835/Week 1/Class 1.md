###### **General Grading Information:**
- 2x Tests (30%)
- 6x Assignments (30%)
- Quizzes (10%)
- Final Assessment (30%) 

###### **Computer Application**
- Software program 
- Set of instructions that get executed and achieve some sort of result 
- ex) Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, Mobile Apps, Video Games

###### **Information System**
- A set of interrelated components that collects, processes, stores, and provides as output the information needed to complete business tasks
- Combination of hardware and software 
- Includes Database and Related Manuals
-  ex) Mobile Phone Systems, Online Banking

###### **What is a Project**
- Temporary endeavor to create product or services or result 
- Must have a beginning and an end
- **SDLC**  | **System Development Life Cycle** 
	1. Identify the problem or need and obtain approval 
	2. Plan and monitor the project (Time + Cost + Scope = Quality)
	3. Discover and understand the details of the problem or need 
	4. Design the system components that solve the problem 
	5. Build, test, and integrate system components 
	6. Complete system tests and then deploy the solution

###### **The Project Team**
![[Pasted image 20240905174449.png]]

###### **System Analysis**
- Those activities that enable a person to understand and specify what an information system should accomplish
###### **System Design**
- Those activities that enable a person to define and describe in detail the system that solves the need
###### **Waterfall development** 
- An approach to system development in which the system is developed following a structured method  
- Rigorous planning and strict control
	- Linear 
	- Rigid with minimal reusability 
	- Data flow diagrams and entity relationships
	- Sequential. Cant proceed to next step before current step is finished 

^methodology-def
	- **Methodology**: 
		1. **Analysis:** 
			- Research and understand the problem
			- Identify stakeholders, business needs, document processes
		2. **System Design:** 
			- Conceptualize computer system solutions
			- Develop solutions 
			- Define the system to be developed 
		1. **Implementation:** 
			- Coding, creating data structures, installation
		2. **Testing:** 
			- Find bugs
			- Error tracking 
			- System security 
			- Quality assurance
		3. **Deployment:**
			- Confirm desired results are obtained
			- Determine any final changes
		4. **Maintenance:**
			- Maintain the software

###### **Agile development** 
- An information system development process that emphasizes flexibility to anticipate new requirements during development  
- Fast on feet; responsive to change  
	- Effective for GUIs
	- Small changes allowed 
	- OOP
	- **Methodology:** 
		- ![[Pasted image 20240907134140.png]]
		- [[#^methodology-def | Methodology]] definitions remain the same but the process is more dynamic.

###### **Iterative development**
- An approach to system development in which the system is “grown” piece by piece through multiple mini-projects called iterations

###### **Why Does Software Fail**
- Deadlines not met
- Budgets exceeded
- Solutions do not work 
- Many other reasons

###### **Project**
- A planned undertaking that has a beginning and an end
- Produces some definite result 
###### **Program**
- A group of projects that are related 
###### **Portfolio**
- A collection of projects or programs 
###### **What is a Use Case**
- A list of actions or event steps that define interactions between actor and system 
- Actor can be human or external system
