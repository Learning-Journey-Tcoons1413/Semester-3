### **Intro to Assignment 2**

#### Part A

**Console App**
- Practice inheritance 
- Shape class is abstract 
- Don't have shape class and everything inherits from that and that only 
	- must be at least a three level hierarchy 
- **MENU**
	- User enters a shape they want
	- Program will ask for dimensions 
	- Check for invalid information 
	- Then program will show all the shapes 

- **Dimensions** 
	- Don't have input output in the model 
	- set data method will violate this 

- **Classes**
	- Every class is in its own file 

#### Part B

**Form App**
