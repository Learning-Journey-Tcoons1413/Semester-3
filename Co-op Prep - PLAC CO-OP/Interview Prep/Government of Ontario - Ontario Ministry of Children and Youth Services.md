###### **REST API**
- Representational State Transfer
- Web based API
- **Main** **Purpose**: Build web services for web, mobile, desktop apps
- Uses HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)  Standard protocol for communication for the internet
	- GET
	- POST
	- PUT
	- DELETE
- Each resource in REST is identified by a unique URL and the response is a JSON or XML format

- **Essential** **Feature**: follows stateless client-server model
	- The server does not store any information about the clients state between requests.

- **When to use:**
	- Building web services that require stateless, scalable, and easy to maintain architecture 
	- Building CRUD apps (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
	- Chat applications, Streaming Services

###### **SOAP API**
- Simple Object Access Protocol 
- Used for exchanging structured data between different applications regardless of the programming language used
- Web based Programming Application Interface that follows the SOAP protocol 
- Uses XML as the format for sending and receiving data and provides a wide range of data types 
- Supports multiple transfer protocols (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, File Transfer Protocol)

- **Advanced Security**
	- Digital Signatures
	- Encryption

- **When to use**
	- Building apps that require highly secure and reliable method of exchanging data between applications 
	- Ideal for handling complex data structures and business logic 
###### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

- **Purpose:** Used for transferring web pages on the internet.
- **How It Works:** Operates over TCP/IP and facilitates communication between web browsers and servers. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.
- **Common Usage:** Accessing websites (e.g., when you type a URL in your browser).

###### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- **Purpose:** Used for sending emails across networks.
- **How It Works:** Operates on a client-server model, allowing the sending of messages from a client (like an email application) to a mail server and between servers.
- **Common Usage:** Sending emails, typically from an email client to the server.

###### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- **Purpose:** Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
- **How It Works:** Operates over TCP/IP, allowing users to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers.
- **Common Usage:** File sharing, website maintenance, and backups.
###### **XML**

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed for storing and transporting structured data. Here are the key points about XML:

**key Features**

- **Text-Based:** XML files are plain text, making them easy to read and write.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** It organizes data in a tree-like structure with nested elements, allowing for complex representations.
- **Self-Descriptive:** Data is enclosed in tags that describe its content, making it intuitive to understand.
- **Extensible:** Users can create custom tags, allowing XML to adapt to various applications and data structures.
- **Well-Formed and Valid:** A well-formed XML document adheres to syntax rules, while a valid XML document conforms to a defined schema (like DTD or XML Schema).

**Common Uses**

- **Data Exchange:** Frequently used for data interchange between systems, especially in web services and APIs.
- **Configuration Files:** Many applications utilize XML for configuration settings due to its readability.
- **Document Formats:** Formats such as SVG (for graphics) and XHTML (a variant of HTML) are based on XML.
- **Web Services:** Protocols like SOAP use XML for message formatting.

**Example of XML**

Here’s a simple XML document representing a book:
```xml
<book> 
	<title>Learning XML</title> 
	<author>Jane Doe</author> 
	<year>2024</year> 
	<publisher>Tech Books Publishing</publisher> 
</book>
```
