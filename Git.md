*NOTE: If you have just created a new repo, you must copy and paste the code from GitHub into the git bash terminal before you ACP.*

1. Open git bash in the root level of repo:

![[20240901-1655-31.0913638.mp4]]

2. Inside the git bash terminal, add changed files to staging: ADD

```sh
git add .
```

3. Commit changes to git: COMMIT

```sh
git commit -m "descriptive message indicating the changes made before commiting"
```

4. Push the changes to git hub: PUSH

```sh
git push origin main
```
