###### **Why Test**
- Growing field 
- Good starting position 

###### **Defining Software Testing**
- Investigation that is done to provide information on a software program 

###### **Goal**
- Find bugs 

###### **V-Model**

###### **Quality Assurance**
- Monitoring and evaluation of different aspects of a product to ensure that standards of quality are being used
- **Goal:**
	- Ensure processes and procedures are followed 
	- Reduce the probability of bugs being introduced to the software in the first place 

###### **Programmers Involvement in Testing**
- Build code that is well-documented that follows best practices and provide proof that the code meets specifications

###### **International Standard Organization (ISO)**
- ISO 9000 is Quality Assurance 
- ISO Standard for Software Development:
	1. ISO 9001
	2. ISO 9000-3
- Areas that need to be addressed for software development  
- ISO 9000-3, Primary Areas of Concern  
	 configuration management,  
	 change control,  
	 development planning,  
	 quality planning,  
	 design and implementation,  
	 testing and validation  
	 maintenance.

###### **ISO Certification:**
What are the two main goals of the ISO 9000 process?  
1. Targets the Development Process – How does an organization complete its work.  
2. Tells an organization what process to follow to achieve quality.  
	- What needs to be done – Does not enforce a particular method.

###### **Limitations of Software Testing**
- [Interesting Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/10-famous-bugs-in-the-computer-science-world/)
- Not all bugs will be found 
- Tests can not cover all cases 
- Some bugs are too risky to fix 
- May not be worth the tim e to fix
